# Veterinary Biochemistry Analyzer Report Application

Create a comprehensive web application that generates professional biochemistry analyzer reports for veterinary animals. The application should collect patient information, laboratory test results, and generate a formatted PDF report with interpretations.

## Application Requirements

### 1. Patient Information Section
Create input fields for:
- **Patient Name** (text input)
- **Species** (dropdown: Dog, Cat, Horse, Cattle, Sheep, Goat, Pig, Bird, Rabbit, Other)
- **Breed** (text input)
- **Age** (number input with unit selector: years/months/weeks)
- **Weight** (number input with unit selector: kg/lbs)
- **Medical Record Number** (text input)
- **Date of Collection** (date picker)
- **Date of Report** (date picker, default to today)
- **Attending Veterinarian** (text input)

### 2. Laboratory Test Results Sections

#### Hepatic (Liver) Function Panel
- **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)** - input field with unit (U/L)
- **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)** - input field with unit (U/L)
- **Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)** - input field with unit (U/L)
- **Total Bilirubin** - input field with unit (mg/dL or μmol/L)

#### Renal (Kidney) Function Panel
- **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)** - input field with unit (mg/dL)
- **Creatinine** - input field with unit (mg/dL)

#### Pancreatic Function Panel
- **Amylase** - input field with unit (U/L)
- **Lipase** - input field with unit (U/L)

#### Glucose & Electrolytes Panel
- **Glucose** - input field with unit (mg/dL)
- **Sodium (Na+)** - input field with unit (mEq/L)
- **Potassium (K+)** - input field with unit (mEq/L)
- **Chloride (Cl-)** - input field with unit (mEq/L)

#### Proteins & Other Panel
- **Total Protein** - input field with unit (g/dL)
- **Albumin** - input field with unit (g/dL)
- **Globulin** - input field with unit (g/dL) - auto-calculated as Total Protein - Albumin
- **Cholesterol** - input field with unit (mg/dL)
- **Phosphorus** - input field with unit (mg/dL)
- **Calcium (Ca++)** - input field with unit (mg/dL)

### 3. Reference Ranges & Interpretation
Include species-specific reference ranges for each parameter. The application should:
- Display reference ranges next to each input field
- Automatically flag abnormal values (High/Low/Critical)
- Provide color coding (Green: Normal, Yellow: Borderline, Red: Abnormal)
- Generate automated interpretations based on the provided clinical significance information

### 4. Additional Features
- **Clinical Notes Section** - Large text area for veterinarian comments
- **Test Method/Analyzer** - Input field for equipment used
- **Laboratory Information** - Fields for lab name, address, phone
- **Quality Control** - Checkbox for "Results reviewed and approved"

### 5. PDF Report Generation
The PDF report should include:
- Professional header with laboratory logo placeholder
- Patient demographics in a clean table format
- Test results organized by panels with reference ranges
- Abnormal values clearly highlighted
- Automated interpretations for each panel
- Clinical significance explanations
- Footer with laboratory contact information
- Digital signature area for the veterinarian

### 6. User Interface Requirements
- Clean, professional medical interface design
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Form validation to ensure all required fields are completed
- Save/Load functionality for draft reports
- Print preview before PDF generation
- Clear navigation between sections
- Progress indicator showing completion status

### 7. Technical Specifications
- Use modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- Implement client-side PDF generation (using libraries like jsPDF or Puppeteer)
- Include proper form validation and error handling
- Ensure data privacy and security considerations
- Make the application work offline once loaded
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### 8. Reference Ranges by Species
Include comprehensive reference ranges for common veterinary species:
- Canine (Dog)
- Feline (Cat)
- Equine (Horse)
- Bovine (Cattle)
- Ovine (Sheep)
- Caprine (Goat)
- Porcine (Pig)
- Avian (Bird)
- Lagomorph (Rabbit)

### 9. Clinical Interpretation Engine
Implement automated interpretation based on:
- Single parameter abnormalities
- Pattern recognition (e.g., cholestatic pattern: elevated ALP + GGT)
- Species-specific considerations
- Age-related variations
- Clinical correlations between different parameters

### 10. Report Customization Options
- Laboratory letterhead upload
- Custom reference ranges
- Additional test parameters
- Veterinarian signature upload
- Report template selection
- Language localization options

## Expected Output
The final application should be a complete, functional veterinary biochemistry report generator that produces professional-quality PDF reports suitable for clinical use, with proper medical formatting and comprehensive interpretations based on the provided clinical guidelines.
